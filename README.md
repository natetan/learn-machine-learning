A repo dedicated to learning machine learning in both Python and R.

### Importing the libraries
**Python**  

```Python
import numpy as np                # matematical tools
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot  # plotting tools 
import pandas as pd               # import and manage datasets
```

The keyword `as` lets us use custom shortcut names for out packages.

**R**
R has most of these already built in, but there will be some packages in the future that we're going to need

### Running code in the console
This is the same for both R and Python. **Highlight** (or the entire file) the selected portion of 
the code you want to run, then hit `Command + Enter`
